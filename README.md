![](Importers image.jpg)
## Introduction
This project is an exploratory data analysis with SQL. The data used to do the analysis is based on data imported form the Wide Worlds Importers. I used 5 tables to explore the data for this exercise. We used the data to determine the total sales, the variation of profit and analyze the profit margin ratio.

## Concepts Used
 I performed the following SQL.
Join
CTE 
Aggregate function 
Temp table 
Case when 
Windows function 
Filters
View
The code can be find in the file uploaded 

# Conclusion
The data provided the ability to pull and combine the tables together to draw more insights. I was able to find relevant information and apply many SQL concepts.
